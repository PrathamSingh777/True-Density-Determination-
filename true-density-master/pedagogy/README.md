#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: The User will be able to perform the selection of sample of pharmaceutical powder and can weigh them individually or with other variables also. By doing this on their own user get the concepts and the purpose of each component. Based on the readings they will have to perform several set of calculations which can be further putted in the formulas to calculate the values of True density.
