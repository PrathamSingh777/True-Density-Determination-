## Storyboard (Round 2)


Experiment 2: True density Determination of Pharmaceutical powders.

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on the determining the true density of some pharmaceutical powder samples by using **Liduid displacement method**. Student proceeds with the simulator to understands the concept of density by experimentation. The value of the true volume is determined by performing several sets of calculations for a specified powder sample. User has the liberty to select a powder sample from the given one. The weighing of powder and other variables with pycnomter can be done with the help of weighing balance visible on the screen of simulator and the readings will be recorded at a separate tab. The final objective is to find out the value of True density of specified powder samples. By performing this experiment the student will be able to understands the concept of density and to apply their concepts to calculate several variables and ultimately to calculate the true density. This experiment also helps to analyse that the student is able to make an assumption regarding the selection of API or excipient for Pharmaceutical product development and processings. 
### 2. Story:

Density is universally defined as mass per unit volume but it becomes difficult when experimentation is done with the powders which particles with microscopic cracks, internal pores and capillary spaces. So, on the basis of the determination of densities, different types of densities are: Bulk density, Tapped density, Granular density and True density. The True orAbsolute density  is defined as the mass (M) of a powder divided by its true volume (T.V.). True volume is the actual volume occupied by the powder particles. It does not include inter and intra particle spaces. The true volume of a powder particle depends on type of atoms in the molecule, arrangement of atoms in the molecule and arrangement of molecules in the substance. True density of a powder is used for qualitative analysis of powders <Br>
 
True density of a powder can be found out by liquid displacement method (or) helium densitometer method. **In the present experiment liquid displacement method is used**. The principle in liquid displacement method is the volume of liquid displaced by the powder is equal to true volume of the powder. One condition is that the solid powder should be insoluble in the liquid and should be denser than the liquid used in liquid displacement method. <Br>

The simulator setup consists of a "weighing balance" with specifications like power on/off button and a Pycnometer. In the variable bar there is a flexibility of slecting a powder sample. The liquid used in experimentation is fixed i.e. water to avoid the confusion during the experiment.
Several weighings is to be done like empty pycnometer, pycnometer with water, pycnomter with powder sample and pycnomter with water and powder sample. The value of these weights are further putted into various set of combinations of formulas to achieve the desired output i.e. "true density of the sample powder.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:

 1. A list of the powder sample. The student shall select one sample from Benzioc acid or Salicylic acid.
 2. A pycnometer for the purpose of diffrent weighings
 3. A list of variables from which the combination of weighnings is to be slected.
 4. A "Switch On/Off" button to start and stop the weighing balance.
