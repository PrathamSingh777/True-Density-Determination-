### **Steps for Determining the True Density of Pharmaceutical Powder (Liquid Displacement Method)**

The true density of a pharmaceutical powder can be determined using the liquid displacement method, which involves measuring the volume of liquid displaced by the powder. Below are the detailed steps for conducting this experiment:

---

### **Materials Required:**
1. Pharmaceutical powder sample (known mass)
2. Liquid with known density (commonly used liquids are mercury, benzene, or water, depending on the powder's properties)
3. Density bottle or pycnometer
4. Analytical balance (for precise measurement of mass)
5. Thermometer (if temperature control of the liquid is required)
6. Stirring rod (for homogeneity, if needed)

---

### **Experimental Procedure:**

1. **Preparation of the Equipment:**
   - Clean the density bottle (or pycnometer) thoroughly to ensure there are no contaminants or residual substances that could affect the results.
   - Ensure that the powder sample is dry and free from moisture or other impurities that could alter its density.

2. **Weigh the Density Bottle:**
   - Weigh the empty, clean density bottle accurately using the analytical balance. Record this weight as \( W_1 \) (mass of the empty bottle).
   
3. **Add Liquid to the Bottle:**
   - Fill the density bottle with the chosen liquid (e.g., mercury or benzene). The liquid should be carefully chosen based on its density and the powder's characteristics to ensure that the powder is denser than the liquid and does not dissolve in it.
   - Ensure that the bottle is filled such that there is no air bubble, and the liquid meniscus is at the correct level, typically at the top of the neck of the density bottle.
   - Weigh the bottle filled with liquid. Record this weight as \( W_2 \) (mass of the bottle with liquid).

4. **Weigh the Powder Sample:**
   - Weigh the exact amount of the pharmaceutical powder using the analytical balance. Record this weight as \( W_{\text{powder}} \) (mass of the powder sample).

5. **Add Powder to the Liquid:**
   - Carefully add the powdered sample into the density bottle containing the liquid. Gently tap the bottle or stir it slightly to ensure the powder settles properly and that no air pockets remain inside the powder mass. The powder should not dissolve in or react with the liquid.

6. **Weigh the Bottle with Powder and Liquid:**
   - After the powder has been added and any trapped air has been removed, weigh the density bottle again, ensuring that the meniscus of the liquid is at the correct level.
   - Record this weight as \( W_3 \) (mass of the bottle with powder and liquid).

7. **Determine the Volume of the Powder:**
   - The volume of the powder is determined by the difference in the mass of the liquid displaced by the powder. The amount of liquid displaced corresponds to the true volume of the powder. 
   
   Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume of liquid displaced (True Volume of the powder)} = (W_3 - W_2)
   \]

8. **Calculate the True Density of the Powder:**
   - True density is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{True Density} = \frac{W_{\text{powder}}}{(W_3 - W_2)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( W_{\text{powder}} \) is the weight of the powder,
   - \( (W_3 - W_2) \) is the true volume of the powder (the volume of liquid displaced by the powder).

---

### **Conclusion:**
- The true density of the pharmaceutical powder is obtained by dividing the mass of the powder by the volume of liquid it displaces.
- This value is a critical parameter in understanding the materialâ€™s porosity, compaction behavior, and suitability for various pharmaceutical applications.

### **Precautions:**
1. Ensure the powder is dry and free from moisture to avoid altering the density measurements.
2. Choose a liquid that is denser than the powder and will not interact chemically with it.
3. Handle the density bottle carefully to avoid spillage and ensure accurate measurements.
4. Ensure that there is no air trapped in the powder during the procedure, as it will interfere with the measurement of the true volume.
